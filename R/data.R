#' @format This data set comes from a network study of corporate law partnership that was

#' It includes (among others) measurements of networks among the 71 attorneys (partners and associates) of this firm,

#' are also part of the dataset, including seniority, formal status, office in which they work, gender, lawschool attended,
#' individual performance measurements (hours worked, fees brought in),
#' attitudes concerning various management policy options, etc.
#' lazega is a network object compatible with library(network).
#' This network is directed.  It has the following vertex attributes:
#' \emph{name}, \emph{Seniority}, \emph{Status} (1 means partner), \emph{Gender} (1 is man, 2 is woman),
#'  \emph{Office} (1 is Boston, 2 is Hartford, 3 is Providence), \emph{Years} (years with the firm),
#' \emph{Age}, \emph{Practice} (1 is litigation, 2 is corporate), and
